Program run_analysis.R
----------------------
This program performs the following functions:
* Combines training and test datasets to form a single dataset
* Extracts the columns containing Means and SDs for 33 different measurement variables
* Calculates the average of each of these 66 variables separately for each subject (n=30) and activity (n=6)
* Creates a resulting _tidy dataset_ that has the following structure:
  * 180 observations, one for each combination of subject and activity
  * 68 variables, listed in Codebook below
  * the first two variables are Identifiers -- Subject and Activity
  * the other 66 variables are calculated means for measurement variables
  * this data is Tidy because each measurement variable has its own column, each observation (subject/activity) has its own row, and it is one cohesive table containing a single kind of data (means of activity measurements)
  * the output data has been saved as a text file names ProjectTidy.txt, described below

  ### Identifying Variables (2)
  Subject: Subject ID number, ranges from 1 to 30
  Activity: One of six activities (Walking, WalkingUpstairs, WalkingDownstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying

  ### Summary Variables (66)
  The following variables follow the same naming convention: Mean.<measurement>.Mean -- mean of means; Mean.<measurement>.SD -- mean of SDs
